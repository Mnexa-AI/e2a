# @e2a/mcp-server

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [e2a](https://e2a.dev) — gives any MCP-aware AI agent its own email inbox to send, receive, reply, and (optionally) review held outbound mail before it ships.

Works with Google ADK, LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, and any other MCP host.

## Connect

e2a's MCP server is hosted. Point your MCP host at the Streamable HTTP endpoint:

```
https://api.e2a.dev/mcp
```

Two ways to authenticate:

- **OAuth 2.1 (recommended for interactive hosts)** — add e2a as a connector and authorize in the browser. No key is pasted into config.
- **Bearer API key (programmatic / self-host)** — send your [e2a dashboard](https://e2a.dev) API key in the `Authorization: Bearer <e2a API key>` header.

An agent-scoped credential resolves its agent server-side. Account-scoped callers pass the agent `email` per tool call.

## Quick start

### Google ADK (Python)

```python
import os

from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import McpToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPConnectionParams

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-flash-latest",
    name="e2a_agent",
    instruction="Help the user manage their email. Reply to threads with `reply_to_message` to preserve threading headers.",
    tools=[
        McpToolset(
            connection_params=StreamableHTTPConnectionParams(
                url="https://api.e2a.dev/mcp",
                headers={
                    "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['E2A_API_KEY']}",
                },
                timeout=30,
            ),
        ),
    ],
)
```

### LangChain (Python)

Using [`langchain-mcp-adapters`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters):

```python
import os

from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

client = MultiServerMCPClient({
    "e2a": {
        "transport": "streamable_http",
        "url": "https://api.e2a.dev/mcp",
        "headers": {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['E2A_API_KEY']}",
        },
    },
})

tools = await client.get_tools()
agent = create_react_agent("anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6", tools)
```

### OpenAI Agents SDK (Python)

```python
import os

from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
    name="e2a",
    params={
        "url": "https://api.e2a.dev/mcp",
        "headers": {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['E2A_API_KEY']}",
        },
    },
) as e2a:
    agent = Agent(name="e2a_agent", mcp_servers=[e2a])
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Reply to the latest unread email politely.")
```

### Claude Desktop / Cline / Cursor

Add e2a as a remote MCP server in the host's config (`claude_desktop_config.json`, `cline_mcp_settings.json`, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "e2a": {
      "url": "https://api.e2a.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_E2A_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Hosts that support OAuth connectors can instead add `https://api.e2a.dev/mcp` as a connector and authorize in the browser — no key pasted.

## Tools

The server exposes up to **48** tools spanning agents, messages, human-in-the-loop
approval, attachments, domains, events, webhooks, API keys, and email templates
(beta).
**The visible set depends on your credential's scope:** an **agent**-scoped
credential sees the 14 runtime/inbox tools (read, send, reply, and view its
pending queue); an **account**-scoped credential also sees the 34 admin/setup
tools (agent/domain/webhook/event/template/API-key management — **and HITL
approve/reject, which is an account-owner action, never agent self-approval**)
— all 48.
Every tool carries MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`/
`idempotentHint`) so hosts can auto-approve reads and flag destructive actions.
The tables below highlight the most commonly used ones — your MCP host's tool list
shows the set your scope allows, with per-tool descriptions.

### Identity

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `whoami` | Get the authenticated account's identity — user, scope, plan/limits; for an agent-scoped credential, also the bound agent address. |
| `list_agents` | List every agent inbox owned by the authenticated user. |
| `get_agent` | Get one agent inbox by its full email address. |
| `create_agent` | Register a new agent by its full email address — on a verified domain you own, or the deployment's shared domain. No delivery "mode": inbound is always available via `list_messages` (poll) or a `create_webhook` subscription. (Admin/account-scoped.) |

> **Webhook deliveries are signed — verify them.** Push delivery is a top-level
> resource (`create_webhook`), not a per-agent mode. e2a HMAC-signs every webhook
> delivery against the webhook's signing secret (returned once from `create_webhook`
> / `rotate_webhook_secret`). Your handler must verify the signature on every
> request — the [e2a SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@e2a/sdk) exposes
> `constructEvent(rawBody, signatureHeader, secret)` which verifies and returns a
> typed event in one call (throws on a bad signature). Or skip webhooks entirely
> and poll via `list_messages`.

### Messages

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `send_message` | Send a new email. When the agent's outbound policy or content scan holds it for review, the message is held and returns `status: pending_review` instead of `sent`. |
| `reply_to_message` | Reply to a message — one the agent received (replies to its sender) or one it sent (continues the thread to the original recipients). Preserves In-Reply-To / References for thread continuity. |
| `list_messages` | List inbound mail. Filter by `read_status` (unread / read / all); cursor-paginated (`cursor` + `limit` in, `next_cursor` out). |
| `get_message` | Fetch full body, headers, and attachment metadata for one message. |
| `get_attachment` | Get one attachment's metadata + a short-lived `download_url` (fetch the bytes out of band); `inline: true` returns base64 `data` for small files (≤256 KB). |
| `update_message_labels` | Add or remove labels on a message. |

### Human-in-the-loop approval

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list_reviews` | List outbound mail awaiting human approval (the review queue), soonest-expiring first. |
| `get_review` | Get the full draft (subject, recipients, body) of a held message under review. |
| `approve_review` | Send a held message, optionally with reviewer edits (subject / body / recipients). Account-scoped — never agent self-approval. |
| `reject_review` | Discard a held message; the optional `reason` is stored for audit. Account-scoped. |

### Domains

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `register_domain` | Register a custom sending domain; returns the MX + TXT DNS records to publish. (Admin/account-scoped.) |

### API keys

All admin/account-scoped. `create_api_key` mints **agent-scoped keys only** —
the key is bound to one inbox and can act only as that agent. Account-scoped
(workspace-admin) keys cannot be created over MCP; mint those from the
dashboard or the raw API, where a human is in the loop.

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list_api_keys` | List the account's API keys — metadata only (secrets are shown once, at creation). |
| `create_api_key` | Mint a new agent-scoped key bound to an inbox; returns the plaintext key ONCE — store it immediately. |
| `delete_api_key` | Revoke a key permanently (requires `confirm: true`). |

### Templates (beta)

Reusable email templates with `{{variable}}` interpolation (a flat Mustache
subset — no loops/sections; missing variables render as empty strings), plus a
read-only catalog of pre-built starters (`welcome`, `verify-code`,
`password-reset`, `receipt`, `agent-status`, `daily-digest`,
`approval-request`). Send with a template via `send_message`'s `template_id` /
`template_alias` + `template_data` (mutually exclusive with literal
subject/body). All template management tools are admin/account-scoped. Beta —
shapes may change before templates are declared stable.

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list_templates` / `get_template` | List the account's stored templates (summary rows); `get_template` returns the full body sources. |
| `create_template` | Create a template from literal source — or copy a starter verbatim with `from_starter`. |
| `update_template` / `delete_template` | Edit (re-parses changed parts) or delete a template. |
| `validate_template` | Dry-run source: parse errors, a rendered preview against `test_data`, and `suggestedData` placeholders. |
| `list_starter_templates` / `get_starter_template` | Browse the starter catalog; the detail view includes full body sources and per-variable metadata. |

## Errors

Every failed tool call returns an MCP result with `isError: true` and **two
representations of the error**:

- **`structuredContent`** — the machine-branchable form. Branch on this, not
  the text:

  ```json
  {
    "code": "domain_not_verified",
    "retryable": false,
    "status": 403,
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "retry_after_seconds": 30,
    "details": { "field": "…" }
  }
  ```

  | Field | Presence | Meaning |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `code` | always | Stable snake_case token from the API error envelope (e.g. `domain_not_verified`, `rate_limited`, `message_not_pending`). Errors raised by the MCP layer itself (bad/missing arguments, `confirm:true` guards) carry `invalid_request`. |
  | `retryable` | always | `true` when a retry could plausibly succeed (rate limit, 5xx, connection failure). |
  | `status` | API errors only | HTTP status of the API response (`0` = connection-level failure). Absent when no request was made (MCP-layer validation). |
  | `request_id` | when available | Server request id — quote it in support requests. |
  | `retry_after_seconds` | when available | Back-off hint for retryable errors. |
  | `details` | when available | Structured field-level detail from the envelope (omitted if oversized). |

- **`content` (text)** — the human-readable form, unchanged and stable:
  `e2a error [<code>] (retryable)?: <message>` for API errors, `e2a error:
  <message>` for MCP-layer errors. Existing agents that parse this text keep
  working, but new integrations should read `structuredContent` instead.

Successful results are unaffected (JSON in a text block; list tools return a
domain-named array plus `next_cursor` while more pages remain).
